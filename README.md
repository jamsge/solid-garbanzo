This is a simple javascript 3D game that runs off of threejs and ammojs. It has nothing to do with solid garbanzos.

To try the game, run [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) in the root directory and go to http://localhost:8080.

It's not really a game right now actually, but I don't care.
