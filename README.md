This is a simple javascript 3D game that runs off of threejs and ammojs. It has nothing to do with solid garbanzos, that was just the default repository name. I should probably change that in the future

To try the game, run [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) in the root directory and go to http://localhost:8080.
